# Parallel-And-Distributed-Computation---Final-Project
Final Project - Afeka College Spring 2020

Sequence Alignment â€“ a way to estimate a similarity of two strings of letters - is an important field in bioinformatics 1.
Sequence is a string of capital letters including hyphen sign (-), for example

Each letter in the sequence represents DNA, RNA, or protein. Identification of region of similarity of
set of Sequences is extremely time consuming. This project deals with a simplified version of
Sequence Alignment of two sequences. The purpose of the project is to parallelize the basic algorithm
to produce an efficient computations within MPI, OpenMP and CUDA environment.
